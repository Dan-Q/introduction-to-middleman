# Mechanism of operation

* You maintain some dymanic content (usually marked-up files, but can be a database, API, CMS, or whatever) representing pages, layouts, stylesheets, scripts, images, etc.
* The static site generator runs (either on-demand, when files are changed, or on a schedule)
* Web resources are generated (HTML, Javascript, CSS, etc.)
* Optionally, these resources are published to a platform (your web server, GitHub Pages, S3, a CDN, etc.)
