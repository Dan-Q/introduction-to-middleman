# Conclusion

* Static sites are fast, secure, portable and can be easily integrated into source control
* They're especially suitable for sites that rarely change or have little user-server interaction
* Static site generators like Middleman, Jekyll and Hugo provide a framework to define your own static site process (or use theirs)
* They draw content from whatever source you like: flat files are common, but databases etc. are suitable too
* You can also adapt (abuse?) them to easily generate "offline" sites, API frontends, auto-documentation, and even presentations
